    <!-- Chosen Palette: Professional Blue & Slate -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page dashboard with a sticky top navigation for easy access to key thematic sections: Ownership, Assets, Milestones, EU Role, ESG, and Outlook. This non-linear structure allows users to explore information based on their interests, making the dense report content more digestible. The flow starts with a high-level introduction, then allows deep dives into specific areas. This dashboard approach is superior to a linear report for quick analysis and synthesis of key data points. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: JORC Resource Tonnages for all major deposits. Goal: Compare the immense scale difference between assets. Viz: Vertical Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) with a logarithmic scale. Interaction: Tooltips on hover provide exact tonnage. Justification: A log scale is essential to visualize both the massive Bjerkreim deposits and the much smaller (but still significant) Skaland mine on the same chart without the smaller bars becoming invisible.
        - Report Info: Corporate Structure. Goal: Clarify ownership hierarchy. Viz: Styled HTML divs in a flow-diagram style. Interaction: None. Justification: A simple, clear visual representation is more effective than text alone.
        - Report Info: Key Milestones. Goal: Show project progression over time. Viz: Vertical timeline with styled HTML/CSS. Interaction: None. Justification: An intuitive and visually appealing way to present chronological events.
        - Report Info: SWOT/Risk analysis. Goal: Summarize strategic position. Viz: 2x2 grid of styled "cards" for clarity and easy comparison. Interaction: None. Justification: Standard, effective business analysis format.
